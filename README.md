# plant-leaf-classification
In this project, We made a Web Application that allows us to take a plant leaf image and then predict if the leaf/plant is healthy or has diseases like rust, scab and multiple diseases. We used Deep Learning which takes in leaf image and gives the predictions.

## Background
Having diseases in plants or crops is not good and detecting what kind of disease it is can really help to make right decisions to remove/prevent the disease. And Deep Learning can really helps in detecting all kinds of plant diesease very accuratly and can be runned through webpages or even mobile phones.

## How it is used?
It is really easy to use. Just go to [this](our link) link. And upload your plant leaf image. After uploading the image, the process will automatically start where the deep learning model will take the image and after a few seconds later, predictions will be shown.
